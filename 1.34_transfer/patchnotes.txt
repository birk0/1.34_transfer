-Reworked State interface to support new buttons
#12.8.22
-Fixed bug with AI which caused transports to "freeze" when assigning an army to naval invade
#16.8.22
-Implemented Naval Supremacy Mechanic, which is calculated based off various naval modifiers at the start of wars and after battles.
-Having Naval Supremacy allows occupying coastal provinces & forts. The time to occupy is modified by blockade efficiency, 
defensiveness and fort level/development in the province
-Successfully occupying provinces with navies will automatically transfer all loot in the province to you and apply
+500% friendly movement speed -75% hostile movement speed and +50% local defensiveness until occupied by enemies again.
-You can gain naval supremacy by defeating enemy ships in battle, providing they have at least 1 galley or 1 heavy ship in the battle.
Likewise if you lose a battle, naval supremacy will be swapped over to the enemy side
-The AI as a base has 50% blockade efficiency since they suck at microing their fleets properly to siege provinces
-If The AI has naval supremacy they will automatically occupy provinces if they have land units performing a naval invasion 
while they are blockading, to help them perform naval invasions faster
-The side which dosent have naval supremacy will suffer from "Compromised Logistics" giving -33% reinforce speed, -33% trade efficiency
and -15% morale recovery speed they also wont be able to perform any of the special naval sieging stuff
-Provinces that are blockaded now have +100% unit recruitment speed, -50% defensiveness and -50% local trade power
-The number of home ports being blockaded will now also apply reinforce speed, trade efficiency and ship combat ability penalties
on top of the original war exhaustion.

 - Fixed error log spam related to PlayerCountry event target being unset
 - Forts now project ZoC on nearby coastal provinces against Naval Occupations

 - Sabotage Recruitment has been buffed to now give +20% Morale of Armies and +33% Manpower Recovery Speed

#26.8.22
 - Introduced Raiding Pact Mechanic, which is a diplomatic option that can be requested of non-pirate countries to pirates
 - A Raiding Pact can be accepted or rejected by the receiver. If they accept, they won't be able to raid your coasts while the pact
 is active. If they reject it, a war will start which will allow you to force them into the pact, while giving them debuffs for losing.
 - The raider bound by the pact can also leave the pact later, when they try to leave it will start a war. If they win, the pact will
 become null. Otherwise, the pact can be reinforced.
 - If any of the pact wars are lost, penalties will be applied, such as losing trade efficiency, trade power and devastation in provs
 while simultaneously boosting the victor.

 - Light ships now cost the same as heavy ships, and doubled their trade power gain to compensate. This will make them more useful for securing trade power too
 - Ships now have a much higher chance of disengaging from naval combat, so entire fleets arent sunk during combat. This does mean that the full morale penalty from ships being sunk is now back.

#3.12.22

#some ideas
#norse japan/siberia/manchuria?
#stab hit diplo action
#no truce timer or lowered truces (to simulate truce breaking in MP)





#ctd stuff
#add a flag for newly created nations to prevent them from forming tags within a month tick of release, apparently there is a ctd when a rebel released tag forms another tag within a month.
#If you colonize a province with no tradegood possibilities, it crashes the game
#referencing province IDs without pixels in provinces.bmp anywhere in common will CTD
#undefined mission_ids can cause crashes

#building triggers kill performance

#approach to bad terrain: eg, desert nomad estate which influence increases from desert provinces and gives camel units which can be recruited from deserts only, just idea to offset very bad development penalties for non-european provinces etc.

#the emperor of china as a decentralised empire:
#basically with the new 1.35 government mechanics we can setup interactions.
#with enough government power any warlord can claim to be the emperor of china
#the current emperor of china has special actions which they can use to affect the government power of other warlords so they cant
#claim the mandate.
#things like winning battles/wars/provinces owned in china etc increase government power
#something like an "influence in china" mechanic, that outsiders can also participate in, and potentially become a warlord themselves
#or contest interest in china. 




#current to do:
#re-balance all technologies
#sort buildings into technology
#add script for the new latent trade goods
#add script for price changes
#rework institutions and tie it in with the price changes and ages
#one golden era per age
#rework some of the age bonuses
