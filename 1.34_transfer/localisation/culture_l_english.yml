The Almavorids and Almohads favored the southern city of Marrakech, while Caliph Yaqub al-Mansur attempted to establish the capital at Rabat.

Since twenty years past almost all power formally held by the Marinid dynasty has in fact been wielded by their formidable Wattasid vizier Abu Zakariya Yahya.\nInsanely popular after his victory over the Portuguese in 1437 and his patronization of the Idrisid cult in Fez, Abu Zakariya Yahya has ensured that the royal bureaucracy is both well functioning and imbued with Wattasid family members. As the Wattasids are related to the Marinid rulers this is in itself perhaps not a worrying development. Now that Abu Zakariya Yahya lies on his deathbed, however, we cannot but wonder what the future will bring. The great man has seemingly left nothing to chance and has already arranged for his cousin to succeed him as Vizier but what remains unclear is what the Wattasid family will do in the future with the network Yahya has built them."

At first, only a small part of the szlachta, or 'noble class', would assert its privilege to choose the next king (or, in 1384 and 1523 Queen, since they backed Jadwiga's and Anna's claims). But eventually the right to elect the ruler of Poland was extended to Polish nobles. Keep in mind that in Poland, nobility was inherited by all children of an entitled person, so at its peak, half a million Poles could claim a voice in the election - by far the widest possible franchise in Renaissance Europe and probably the largest 'democratic' system until American and French Republics. True royal elections began in 1573 at the election of Henry of Valois, since foreign princes were always claiming the Polish throne anyway, why not have the nobles choose among them.\n\nDuring the Commonwealth period, the Kings of Poland and Grand Princes of Lithuania were elected by noble gatherings at a field in Wola, just outside Warsaw. Tens of thousands of nobles could be expected to attend, and the richest magnates would mingle with the poorest count in exchanges of favors and votes. This first election took four days to conclude (future ones would be smaller and over in a day or two) and these events would be full of parties, fairs and armed men. While the election was going on, royal power would be vested in an interrex, a temporary regent - usually the Primate of Warsaw, who would oversee the voting."

While the Eunuchs have so far performed exceptionally well, they are now requesting additional funds from the Imperial Coffers for a lavish and expensive embassy to [eunuch_embassy.GetName]. The Eunuchs claim that maintaining positive relations with [eunuch_embassy.GetName] should be the [Root.GovernmentName]'s upmost priority and the dedication of funds to such a cause is a small sacrifice to be paid. While the Eunuchs may be right, the Bureaucrats also caution the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] that the Eunuchs have in the past used such funds for vain personal pursuits.."

However, a string of weak [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]s has led to a number of influential Eunuch landholders to appear within the [Root.GovernmentName], causing the occasional dispute to arise. In an unfortunate turn of events, such a case has arisen among an influential Eunuch Minister and Bureaucrat in [dispute_province.GetName].Usually we would be wise to steer clear of such unfavourable disputes, however the Eunuchs and Bureaucrats have now taken the liberty of involving the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] himself in the final decision."

In times past it became almost mandatory to bribe state officials to tweak exam results so that those with the ability to pay were favoured over those who held capable skills. Fortunately,such conduct was avoided, as it seems a particularly talented Examiner was hosting the exams this year, and many of the Bureaucratic graduates seem highly promising for the [Root.GovernmentName]'s use."
 estate_eunuchs.6.d.2: "With the current year's Imperial Examinations coming to a close, it is with unfortunate news that [Root.Capital.GetName] hears of the Eunuch's meddling with this year's candiates.

 cac.12.desc_indian: "The influential castes of the [Root.GovernmentName] have long held the right of taxation and governance over the local provinces, much to the dismay of [Root.Monarch.GetName] and the central court. In attempt to limit their political influence, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has begun replacing various regional and local governors loyal to the Castes with members of his own faction loyal to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. In protest to such a move, the Castes are now demanding [Root.Monarch.GetName] reinstate the previous governors, and compensate them for his wrongs."
 cac.12.desc_eastern: "It's no secret that many prominent palace officials hold large swaths of land and private assets which are outside the influence of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Some powerful officials have even begun employing private tax collectors of their own. In an attempt to limit their power, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has forcibly begun arresting private tax collectors and reinstating them with his own officials. In protest to such a move, the officials are now demanding [Root.Monarch.GetName] provide a reason for their arrests, and a reinstatement of their position."
 cac.12.desc_tribal: "The influential tribes of the [Root.GovernmentName] have long held onto large swaths of territory they claim as \"Grazing Lands\" dating back to the foundation of the [Root.GovernmentName] itself. While the acknowledgement of their traditional lands is all well and good, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has become increasingly dissatisfied with the lack of development and infrastructure invested in these \"Empty Fields\" calling them more harm than good. In attempt to increase the state's own power, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has issued a number of administrative changes, one of which is the direct administration of grazing lands by the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].

As the standard of living in cities and built up regions continues to decrease, many are fleeing to the countryside and rural regions in an attempt to secure prosperity and wealth. Coincidently, the regions they're fleeing to happen to be privately owned pilgrims of the [This.GetClergyName]. If we are to reverse such a tide, it must done quickly and swiftly."
 cac.13.desc_eastern: "Recently we have begun to suspect prominent land owning officials of directly working against state interests and encouraging decentralisation. Many families and opportunistic individuals are leaving the cities and built up regions in favour of autonomous regions controlled by wealthy officials, free from state intervention. If we are to reverse such a tide, it must done quickly and swiftly, regardless of how the officials' reaction."
 cac.13.desc_pagan: "Recently we have begun to observe a large scale trend of individuals leaving cities and built up regions in favour of rural and autonomous areas governed by the Elders. Some suspect overtaxation, but more likely the case is the Elder's intervention in such a trend. If we are to reverse such a tide, it must done quickly and swiftly, regardless of how the elders may react."
 cac.13.desc_tribal: "In our [Root.GovernmentName] many are accustomed to the semi-nomadic tribalistic society where one may rest his head beneath one tree and another the next. In recent years we have put considerable effort in encouraging opportunistic individuals to abandon this kind of lifestyle and take up positions in cities and built up regions, however it seems such efforts have reached their limit of fruitfulness. Some suspect overtaxation, others declining living standards, perhaps even tribal intervention. Whatever the case, unless drastic measures are made against this trend, we could witness the entire depopulation of cities and the decline of the central economy."
 cac.13.desc_indian: "With our dominance over the cities and central regions, it seems the Castes have begun encouraging people to leave our domains in favour of a rural lifestyle. Whether they were bribed with riches or better living conditions is hard to determine, however the case remains that many important economic foundations are declining due to this rapid trend in depopulation. Unless drastic measures are made, the situation is likely to worsen."

Prominent advisors and officials are always eager to take a bribe, and such has become the way of our society. However common bribes may be, it seems unprecedented that one may attempt to bribe even [Root.Monarch.GetName] himself, being the highest level of authority in the [Root.GovernmentName]. It seems, however, that the Estates have the audacity to do just that. The question remains, will [Root.Monarch.GetName] yield to the temptation?"

Prominent advisors and officials are always eager to take a bribe, and such has become the way of our society. However common bribes may be, it seems unprecedented that one may attempt to bribe the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] himself, seeing as he represents the very essence of the Republican values. It seems, however, that respect for the republic has fallen just this far, with an influential member of the guilds having the audacity to do just that."

 cac.14.desc_pagan: "Being the highest level of authority in the [Root.GovernmentName], it is certainly not uncommon for prominent Elders and figures to attempt a bribe on the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Depending on the strength of the ruler, the situation could go very well, or take a turn for the worse. It seems a group of religious elite have decided to chance their luck at gaining the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s favour, offering a handsome bribe in exchange for some privileges."
 cac.14.desc_muslim: "It's no secret the [This.GetClergyName] hold many of their positions and land deeds due to dubious behind the scenes deals. It seems the [This.GetClergyName] wish to expand their influence further, and have offered the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] a handsome bribe in exchange for some privileges and additional land rights."
 cac.14.desc_indian: "While it is unfortunate to admit, the commodity of bribes within Indian society is nothing new.

However common bribes may be, it seems unprecedented that one may attempt to bribe even [Root.Monarch.GetName] himself, being the highest level of authority in the [Root.GovernmentName].

Prominent advisors and officials are always eager to take a bribe, and officials often compete over the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s favour with the exchange of bribes.

 cac.15.desc_pagan: "There are many influential figures among the Elders, however one such man, being the local elder in [advisor_homeland.GetName], a wealthy and properous area that makes even [Root.Monarch.GetName] envy has risen to even higher status than most. Many are now suggesting we bring this man before the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to serve as an advisor, however bringing such an influential man into politics could prove more troublesome than continuing the status quo."
 cac.15.desc_eastern: "There are many powerful officials which dominate the palace's political strife, but one such man has risen to prominence that makes even the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] wary. Being the governor of [advisor_homeland.GetName], an immensely wealthy area of the [Root.GovernmentName], he has begun amassing a sphere of influence that could prove troublesome to centralisation efforts in the future. In an attempt to limit his power, some have suggested we bring this man to court to serve as an advisor, however allowing such an influential man at court could be more troublesome than continuing the status quo."
 cac.15.desc_indian: "Within our society, there are many influential members of the castes which rival even the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s power. However, one such man has risen above the majority, proving himself an excellent governor.

 cac.16.d: "We have received word that a large scale Mutiny has occured in [province_mutiny.GetName]. Seeing as these men are likely recruited from the Estates, it is no surprise that the influence of their local lords is greater than their loyalty to the state. While we could purge the ranks of such behaviours, it may cause more harm than good."
 cac.16.desc_republic: "We have received word that a large scale Mutiny has occured in [province_mutiny.GetName]. Clearly their hearts were set upon riches rather than loyalty to the state, making them no better than mercenaries. While we could purge the ranks of such behaviours, it may cause more harm than good."
 cac.16.desc_indian: "The Castes are responsible for providing a large number of men for the Imperial forces, therefore it is no surprise that as a consequence of our recent strife with the Castes that many among our soldiers are beginning to mutiny. Such the case has occured in [province_mutiny.GetName], where a large number of men have deserted the forces and fled into the countryside. While we could purge the ranks of such behaviours, it may be best to let this trend run its course."
 cac.16.desc_muslim: "We have received word that a large scale Mutiny has occured in [province_mutiny.GetName]. Since we become reliant on soldiers of the Pilgrim, it is no surprise that their loyalty lay with the [This.GetClergyName] rather than the state. While we could purge the ranks of such behaviours, it may cause more harm than good."
 cac.16.desc_eastern: "Recent wars have had their toll on the [Root.GovernmentName], forcing us to rely on a number of privately controlled levies in order to maintain our armed forces. As a consequence, the loyalty of these men are to palace officials, rather than the state. Such a case of disloyalty has occured in [province_mutiny.GetName], where a number of men have abandoned their positions and dispersed into the countryside. While we could round them up and punish such acts of disloyalty, it would certainly prove troublesome and costly."
 cac.16.desc_tribal: "Reliance on the tribes instills both a sense of comradeship and mutual trust between the state and local leaders. However, it is unfortunate that in some cases this trust can be betrayed. Such an example of this has occured in [province_mutiny.GetName], where a number of men recruited from the tribes have deserted their position, likely to return to their homelands. Such an act tarnishes the discipline we work hard to instill in our soldiers, making it all the more damaging to our authority over the other tribes."
 cac.16.desc_pagan: "We have received word that the elders have been propagating lies on our war efforts, making it difficult to maintain discipline among our soldiers. It seems their lies are working, as a large scale mutiny has recently occured in [province_mutiny.GetName]. Seeing as these men are likely recruited from the Estates, it is no surprise that the influence of their local lords is greater than their loyalty to the state.

The Estates are still, by some extent, willing to assist us, providing we agree to their terms."

As a consequence of [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s recent strife with dominant guild factions in court, finding new and able men to fill the front lines has become quite a challenging process. Luckily, there are still some influential factions willing to assist us, providing we give them adequete compensation of course."
 cac.17.desc_indian: "The Castes are largely responsible for organising and filling uniforms with able bodied men of the [Root.GovernmentName] to fight in our armies. In attempt to limit their power, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has instituted a new recruitment system which is largely independent from the meddling influence of the Castes. It is regrettable to report, however, that the system has been largely unsuccessful of late. The Castes, as if amused by the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s struggle, have now offered their support in establishing the system's efficiency."
 cac.17.desc_tribal: "We have formely relied upon the Tribes in assisting us in preparation for war time, afterall, it is they that have the young men of our [Root.GovernmentName] under control.\n\nRecently [Root.Monarch.GetName] has instituted a new recruitment system in the effort of improving our current system without the need of tribal influence. This system, however, has been largely a failure. Thankfully, the tribes are still willing to assist the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and have proposed an alternative method."
 cac.17.desc_eastern: "In recent years the strength of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s imperial reserve has been waning, such that the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has become reliant on private levies controlled by palace officials to raise an army for wartime. As a consequence of [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s recent attempts to strengthen his authority over the officials, finding new and able men to fill the front lines has become quite a challenging process. The officials are still, by some extent, willing to assist us, providing we agree to their terms."
 cac.17.desc_pagan: "While refraining from direct influence over the armies, the Elders still by large have control over the recruitment process and assisting in finding able bodied men to serve the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].\n\nThe Elders, however, have used this as an opportunity to demand more privileges from the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Without their aid, it is unlikely that we will be able to continue replenishing our armies, should we need to."
 cac.17.desc_muslim: "The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is largely dependent on the military support of the pilgrims and warriors of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith to assist in times of war. Since our current relations with the [This.GetClergyName] are still at large, we have become unable to seek out warriors of faith in maintaining our already diminished forces. Unfortunately, the [This.GetClergyName] are aware of this, and have proposed [Root.Monarch.GetName] an unfavourable offer."

 cac.18.desc_muslim: "[Root.Monarch.GetName]'s attempt at creating an absolutist utopia has obviously not been received well among the estates.

It seems that the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has begun achieving some degree of progress, as the Caste's resistance to his recent reforms have only continued to increase. However, the Castes have not taken [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s advances lightly, and have gained quite a large number of followers to back their cause.

[Root.Monarch.GetName] had been suspicious of such reports already, however initial investigations were apparently unsuccessful in determining conclusive evidence. It was only upon further investigation by the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] himself that officials sent to \"investigate\" the situation were in fact been bribed into silence, and large portions of the population had been getting overtaxed for years. Unfortunately, the entire situation has turned into quite a large scale crime ring, making it increasingly difficult to break up without causing large scale rebellions."

Accusations of treason, blasphemy and corruption are frequently brought up and even threats of en-masse revolts if [Root.Monarch.GetName] continues to refuse trial.

It is by this that a number of rumours have begun spreading of [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s barbaric conquests, supported by our advisor [Root.Mil_Advisor.GetName].

To make matters worse, a high ranking official, [Root.Mil_Advisor.GetName] has begun to publicize some of this sentiment across the [Root.GovernmentName]. Already, we are seeing large scale desertions."

Its form owes a great debt to the domed squares of Timurid Transoxiana, notably the mosque of Khoja Ahmed Yasawi and the Gur-e Amir. Its form is still transitional, not least in the lack of integration between its internal and external layout. The high-drummed dome is set abruptly, without intermediary, on a square, flat-roofed lower story whose box-like appearance is redeemed by the deep axial arched portals.

The psychological effect produced by this arrangement is fairly different from earlier tombs.

Much of their importance depended on their size, with the square measuring 512 by 159 meters - larger than mostly comparable European plazas.\n\nIts apparent size is magnificent by its low-lying buildings, fronted by a low two-story arcade defining its limits. The buildings accessed by the arcade are primarily functional; shops occupy the first floor while dwellings occupy the second. Their lowness has the further aesthetic impact of exalting the stature of the four buildings that break through the facade; the Shah Mosque, the Sheikh Lotfollah Mosque, the Ali Qapu Palace, and the entrance portal of the Qeysarie Bazaar.\n\nShah Abbas completed the square by adding a monumental portal at the center of each side, granting access to the four aforementioned buildings. With these portals, the square could be interpreted as a gigantic version of the classic four-iwan courtyard which, found in mosques, madrasas, houses, and caravanserais, maintained so tenacious a hold on the imagination of Iranian architects.\nNone of these buildings intruded onto the main central space, whose vast emptiness allowed the square to play a varied role in the life of the city. In turn marketplace, military training and parade ground, execution dock, polo pitch, open-air stage, running track, and arena for animal combats, it was a magnificently illuminated funfair by night and the inevitable center for all kinds of royal entertainments.

Its construction, the work of Ustad 'Ali Akbar al-Isfahani under the direction of Muhibb 'Ali Kika Lala spanned some twenty years. Measuring 52 meters (some 14 meters above the inner dome), no other Persian mosque has a double dome so high. Its broad court, measuring some 70 meters across, was enthusiastically copied by Qajar architects. All these extra requirements were prodigal of space, which accounts for the mosque's huge area of some 140 by 130 meters at its greatest extent. \nThough the mosque's four-iwan plan ostensibly accords with the classical tradition of Persian Islamic architecture, variations of the familiar schema meet the eye at every turn. The east and west iwans lead to domed chambers, a layout customarily reserved for the qibla side alone. Minarets crown both the portal and qibla iwan. \nPerhaps the most unexpected addition, however, is the pair of custom-built madrasas flanking the sanctuary complex. Identical in form, they exhibit the same urge for symmetry that marks the rest of the mosque, giving it an exterior as streamlined as the interior layout."

Some of its details, like the fine stonecutting of its walls, stone-carved dragons, and the distinctive tilework of its vestibule show signs of a highly original local style. Meanwhile, its sheer size provides ample evidence that the emphasis for monumentality which so often recurds in the building of Isfahan was by no means confined to the capital or royal foundations. \nWhile the building employs a standard four-iwan plan, the general lack of symmetry within this framework is marked. Only the north and south sides share similarities in their two stories of student cells. \nThe plan's communal areas, including the vaulted apsidal iwan, are to the east rather than the usual qibla side or entrance complex. Moreover, the madrasa has no separate mosque as the southwest iwan perpendicular to the entrance fulfills this function."

Like many other $DYNASTY$ palaces, the Chehel Sotoun has a deliberately unstable and impermanent air. Thus, some flavor of the festive, hedonistic lifestyle celebrated there still lingers. \nIts eighteen pillars, seeming as thin as matchsticks, seem preposterously inadequate to bear the burden of the apparently massive flat roof. The name, Forty Columns, refers to the reflection of these columns in the water, is surely a reflection of the picturesque fantasy the palace offers. \nLike the Ali Qapu, however, this palace offers an aspect of four-square solidity from its sides and rear, which is in marked contrast from its frail and insubstantial facade. In contrast to the main facade, the rear wall presents a solid mass of masonry from which the principal break is the rear entrance. Despite it trabeated form, it owes more to Sassanid palaces than any other traceable source, for the deep recessed central bay leading to the throne room operates like a Sassanid iwan."

The madrasa and caravanserai are oriented along the same eastward axis, marked by the entrance portal of the madrasa and continued in the pools of both buildings, which extend even to the stables closing off the complex at the west end. A pathway and pool divide the courtyard into four miniature gardens, perhaps intended as a peaceful echo of the wider Chahar Bagh outside. To the north, the bazaar knits together the two larger buildings. It comprises a single broad corridor some 220 meters in length symmetrically bordered by multiple arcades on both sides. \n\nThe scale is impressive and the planning is rational and meticulous to the last detail. The confident marshalling of such large forms would be a heritage bequeathed to the later Zand and Qajar architects, and is arguable the greatest strength of Persian architecture in post-$DYNASTY$ times."

The Chehel Sotoun and Ali Qapu palaces host ambitious figural schemes preserved in much of their original splendour. They show an almost total dependence on the repertoire of contemporary book illumination, with its emphasis on intimate courtly scenes and occasional (frankly erotic) flavor. \n\nAt Ali Qapu, for instance, the artists declined to exploit the varied wall surface available to them, preferring to reproduce on a larger scale the rectangular frames of book illumination. As a result, the palace becomes what amounts to a picture gallery, an impression strengthened by the eye-level height of these artificial panels and the deliberately muted floral or other non-figural motifs which fill the intervening spaces.

Particularly famous are the folios by the esteemed painter Sultan Muhammad, whose work shows the emergence of a measured synthesis of Behzadian reason and Turkmen energy. With its meticulous detail, unparalleled draftsmanship, energetic composition, and brilliant colors, Sultan Muhammad's famous rendering of the Court of Gayumars was given special praise, for it was regarded as the zenith of $DYNASTY$ painting, for the hearts of the boldest painters were grieved, and they hung their head in shame before it."
