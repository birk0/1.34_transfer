 new_institution_events.4.b: "We have other concerns."
 new_institution_events.5.t: "Byzantine Refugees"
 new_institution_events.5.d: "My Lord, Byzantium has fallen to the Saracens. The last bastion of the Roman Empire, the City of Constantine, is now in Turkish hands. As Christendom reels from the shock, Byzantine refugees flock to the cities and courts of Europe, bringing with them old manuscripts of classical knowledge, tracts by Aristotle, Plato and Galen, and a thorough knowledge of both Latin and Greek. Inviting these refugees to $COUNTRY$ might provide an enormous boost to our own efforts in the fields of culture and science."

 new_institution_events.5.b: "No, we don't need their help"
 new_institution_events.6.t: "The Way of Tea"
 new_institution_events.6.d: "While tea had been grown in Japan at least since the 9th century, the more refined aesthetics of the Chanoyu, The Way of Tea, only developed fully during the early parts of the 15th century. Part religious ceremony, and part cultural tradition, The Way of Tea could become an integral part of our cultural heritage."

 new_institution_events.9.b: "Issue a decree which bans the manuscripts."
 literacy_pamphlets: "Pamphlets"
 new_institution_events.10.t: "Pamphlets"
 new_institution_events.10.d: "Pamphlets have spread throughout Asia earlier throughout the 14th century as a means of spreading information or ideas, however the widespread use of pamphlets as a means of propaganda was initially a difficult feat due to much of the population being unable to read or write. However, the development of a formalised writing system in the past century has allowed Asian societies to increase the literacy of their population, which in turn makes the spread of information and ideas by the government easier to convey to the less educated."
 new_institution_events.10.a: "Encourage the development of these Pamphlets!"

 literacy_novels: "Spread of Novels"
 new_institution_events.11.t: "Novels"

 new_institution_events.12.t: "Spread of Writing"
 new_institution_events.12.d: "Traditionally much of our history has been recorded via oral tradition, fathers would tell their sons the accounts of their history, in which that son would then tell his children. Information that was forgotten or lost throughout the generations could subsequently never be recovered once the elders which could account those events had passed.\nWith the spread of ideas such as the Renaissance and a formalised writing system, some of the educated elite in our [Root.GovernmentName] have begun to create forms of writing which can convey information that can be stored on parchment, books and manuscripts."

 new_institution_events.12.b: "The old ways are best."
 new_institution_events.13.t: "The South German Organ Tradition"

Unfortunately, his efforts have reached a roadblock in the form of being unable to widely publish his works easily, due to the lacking integrity of the [Root.GovernmentName]'s printing industry.\n [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] has now approached the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], drafting a means by which his works can be published easily among prominent figures in the [Root.GovernmentName], alongside the establishment of the first state supported Printing Press."

 new_institution_events.15.b: "What rubbish!"
 new_institution_events.16.t: "Newspapers"
 new_institution_events.16.d: "The spread of paper and literacy has led to the development of formalised printing presses capable of publishing commodities such as books and novels at speeds which were previously not possible. As the spread of information is made more readily available through the spread of government presses, alongside private owned ones, the development of propaganda in the form of pamphlets and newspapers has become increasingly popular to promote ideological movements."

 printing_press_newspapers: "Newspapers"
 new_institution_events.17.t: "Spreading Heresy?"
 new_institution_events.17.d: "Reports have surfaced within the court regarding the widespread adoption of the printing press among the populace. This technological leap prompts discussions among the advisors about its profound influence on the practice of the Catholic faith, previously confined within Latin texts comprehensible to only a select few.\nAmong the courtiers, proponents advocate leveraging this advancement. They suggest employing the printing industry to fortify their authority and emphasize the fundamental principles of the faith among the subjects.\nConversely, others in the court approach this development cautiously, expressing concerns about potential misinterpretations or alterations to the sacred teachings.\nIn the ensuing months, the printing presses within the realm toil incessantly, producing translated religious texts. The once distant and elusive teachings of the faith, due to language barriers, now resonate with the hearts of the people. This integration of the printing press acts as a conduit, forging a stronger connection between the Church and the populace, fortifying both faith and governance within the realm."
 new_institution_events.17.a: "We should take control of the spread."
 new_institution_events.17.b: "Ban the production of these texts!"
 new_institution_events.18.t: "Religious Pamphlets"
 new_institution_events.18.d: "The transformative invention of the printing press has swept through the fabric of [Root.GetAdjective] society, which has begun to provoke discussions among our advisors about how it may be utilised to further spread the influence of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith among the newly formed reformed christian communities which have branched away from the Catholic Church.\nAmong their circles, advocates passionately embrace the institution, proposing that the printing industry is a potent tool to propagate [Root.Religion.GetName] beliefs, intending to fortify our theological principles among the people.\nSome, however, caution over the potential ramifications of such widespread dissemination, acknowledging the likelihood of heightened tensions and divisions between [Root.GetName] and the Catholic Church."

Yet, amidst the anticipation, some [Root.Religion.GetName] scholars have voiced concern over the potential perils of easier access to these sacred texts. They fear the risk of misinterpretation, distortion of the foundational beliefs, and the spread of heretical interpretations which have taken root in western societies already."
 new_institution_events.19.a: "They need to get with the times!"
 new_institution_events.19.b: "The texts must remain sacred."
 new_institution_events.20.t: "Parchment Revolution"
 new_institution_events.20.d: "Use of paper throughout islamic societies began during the first contact with chinese scholars in Persia. Paper arrived as a silent revolution, heralding an era of enlightenment within the realms of Islamic learning, sciences, and scholarship. Paper swiftly replaced older methods of writing such as parchment and papyrus, serving as a novel medium which revolutionized the way knowledge was preserved and disseminated, spurring advancements in mathematical, scientific, and astronomical studies.\nWord has reached us of a quickly spreading paper-making method known as the printing press. It improves the efficiency of paper-making and writing to levels which were previously thought impossible. Muslim scholars, both within the esteemed halls of learning and the bustling bazaars, embrace this newfound institution with fervor.\nWith the aid of private printing presses, the wisdom contained within Islamic scriptures, scientific treatises, and philosophical works traverses boundaries, reaching scholars and laypeople alike."

Woodblock printing techniques, meticulously crafted, led to the reproduction of some of the first written materials, heralding an era where the dissemination of political information and propaganda emerged as a powerful tool for governance.\nWith newer methods of paper-making spreading throughout china, surrounding [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]s, knowing the cognizant of the potency of these printing presses, have recognized their pivotal role in administering the vast territories and diverse populace of China. With an astute understanding of the impact of information dissemination, these rulers have the potential to mass-produce edicts, proclamations, and political messages across the expanse of their empire."

 new_institution_events.23.t: "Spreading Technology"
 new_institution_events.23.d: "Word has reached the [Root.GetAdjective] court of the increasing spread of the printing press industry. This discipline, primarily originating from China and spreading through the rest of Asia has played a pivotal juncture in the intellectual and cultural evolution of [Root.Religion.GetName] societies.\nAs the printing press spreads, many of our neighbours have recognized the potential of the printing press as a conduit for disseminating knowledge, fostering unity, and bolstering cultural identity. Already, many religious scriptures, literary works, and administrative documents have been reproduced, enriching local languages and dialects, and contributing to the preservation of cultural heritage.\nIn the domain of governance, printed administrative materials have begun to facilitate efficient record-keeping, contributing to efficient bureaucratic systems. As the printing press infiltrates higher levels of administration, rulers have begun to utilize this technology to distribute edicts and administrative decrees, consolidating their authority and fostering a sense of unity among diverse communities."

 new_institution_events.24.t: "Sedentary Knowledge Spreads?"
 new_institution_events.24.d: "Word has spread of a new invention gaining popularity among the sedentary segments of our society, mostly from populations residing at the fringes of our territories. They speak of a printing press, employing strategies to mass-reproduce texts, disseminate knowledge, and foster cultural exchange.\nThe idea of paper-working and the use of parchment is not entirely new in the [Root.GovernmentName] and has since ancient times left a subtle yet enduring mark on our communication practices, heraled for its value as parchment and a medium for transmitting information across great distances.\nDue to our current use of paper-making many in court remain pragmatic over the growing use of this invention, however, others approach this institution with caution over the radical changes it may impose on our way of life and government."

 new_institution_events.25.t: "Sacred Texts Translated"
 new_institution_events.25.d: "The advent of printing presses has begun to mark an important chapter in its history, altering the trajectory of societal evolution. Initially introduced by Chinese emissiaries and traders, the printing press has begun to gain trajectory in a land steeped in rich oral traditions and diverse literary heritage.\nAlready, the institution has begun to play and important role in the preservation and dissemination of ancient Indian texts, philosophical treatises, religious scriptures, and literary works. Sacred texts from Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism have begun to be reproduced, spreading access to spiritual knowledge among the masses.\nThis technological innovation has begun to foster regional languages and dialects, becoming a conduit for cultural expression, empowering local authors and poets to disseminate their works, thus enriching [Root.GetName]'s literary legacy.\nIn the realm of governance, the printing press has begun to empower regional leaders and administrators to disseminate edicts, administrative decrees, and official correspondence, creating efficient bureaucratic systems and enabling more efficient governance."

 institution_events.2.d2: "Since the 14th century, the wealthy and powerful in the [institution_origin.GetRegionName] City states have been patronizing artists and scholars willing to explore the old Roman and Greek societies of their forefathers. As a cultural movement the Renaissance already encompasses most of the region and has had a profound impact on literature, art, philosophy and music. Humanist scholars are also analyzing the society in which they live, comparing it to the ideals of the classical philosophers. At the turn of $YEAR$ Renaissance humanism has grown into a more mature movement, ready to permeate all aspects of society. A new ideal for rulers as well as those who are ruled is spreading as quickly as the early printers can distribute copies of these new ideas. A true Renaissance humanist is an expert on everything from politics and philosophy to art, textual analysis, music and architecture.

But where this was previously limited to a set number of routes and goods such as the manufactured goods of India and China finding their way across the Indian Ocean and along the Silk Road, all trade is now increasingly becoming part of a greater world network. With the discovery of the Far East sea route, direct trade routes have been established from Europe to Asia by the crossing of the Atlantic Ocean, local trade networks are being connected into one world-spanning interconnected web.\n\nSilver mined in Europe is now being boxed and taken via the Atlantic all the way to China and India. Iron mined and wrought in Scandinavia is being sold in West Africa by English merchants, and others are making a fortune just distributing cloth and spices within the South East Asian trade sphere.

Further inventions are helping to greatly ease the transportation of large volumes of goods. With global trade as interconnected as never before, factories can both draw on raw materials from and sell the resulting manufactured goods to markets around the world, bringing in unimaginable riches for their owners.\n\nMeanwhile, the field of agriculture, new practices such as crop rotation and the use of enclosures have similarly increased productivity, meaning that fewer workers are needed to work the same area of land, leading many to abandon their homes and settle in the growing industrial cities.

Allying with the cities would allow us to promote much more durable systems of government but we would likely lose the support of some of the local warrior groups we now rely on for military support."

 new_institution_events.30.t: "Lack of Bureaucracy"
 new_institution_events.30.d: "Sometimes progress will be greater farther from the center of power where old elites are too entrenched to desire change. As new modes of government are becoming more commonplace in our country, locals in [feudalism_province.GetName] are getting increasingly irritated at the elites in [Root.Owner.Capital.GetCapitalName] who refuse to formalize any form of government institutions."

 new_institution_events.31.d: "Through good policies and simple repetition, authority and power can become entrenched enough to promote the growth of permanent government institutions. Over time our government practices have progressed from arbitrary demonstrations of power towards consistency."

 new_institution_events.32.t: "Mirrors for Princes"
 new_institution_events.32.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] has come to take a great interest in Literature, not only for the cultural and artistic merit but also the political and scientific breakthroughs being made in [Root.Capital.GetContinentName]. [Root.Heir.GetTitle] [Root.Heir.GetName] seems oblivious to such things, however, which worries our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. For generations now monarchs in [Root.Capital.GetContinentName] have been able to further their education through the use of books on how to conduct yourself as a ruler. Literature thinkers have been quick to usurp this genre and a number of these 'Mirrors for Princes' now practically reek of the new ideas. We should consider making these books central to the education of [Root.Heir.GetName]."

 new_institution_events.27.d: "As markets across the world begin to open up for foreign investors valuable trade goods such as cloth, silk and linen have become highly sought after for their use in fabric-making and as clothes for upper-class members of society. Already, traders are beginning to completely buy out our existing supplies, which have recently seen a sharp increase in price as supply fails to meet the growing demand for these goods.\nAs the situation reaches a boiling point, many local merchants have gathered to petition the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], stating that swift action is necessary to bring stability back to the rapidly deteriorating economic situation."
