 desc_renaissance: "Since the 14th century, the wealthy and powerful of the greatest cities have been patronizing artists and scholars willing to explore the old Roman and Greek societies of their forefathers. As a cultural movement the Renaissance already encompasses most of the region and has had a profound impact on literature, art, philosophy and music. Humanist scholars are also analyzing the society in which they live, comparing it to the ideals of the Classical philosophers. Renaissance Humanism has grown into a more mature movement, ready to permeate all aspects of society. A new ideal for rulers as well as those who are ruled is spreading as quickly as the early Printers can distribute copies of these new ideas. A true Renaissance Humanist is an expert on everything from politics and philosophy to art, textual analysis, music and architecture. The Renaissance is now ready to reshape the world to better fit its classical ideals."
 desc_printing_press: "The ability to mass-produce the written word would revolutionize the spread of information and in many ways early modern society as a whole. While the ability to produce type set scripts and parchments had being around for centuries in China and other civilisations around the world, it was not until the creation of the Gutenberg Press that the printing industry really begun being a relevant benefactor in politics of the day. Later the Reformation benefitted greatly from the ability to spread critical publications and translations of the Holy Scriptures.\n\nNow that Printing has matured as a technique and spread throughout the world, hundreds of thousands of copies of everything from Religious and Political pamphlets to scientific treatises and instructions on how to behave are circulating the globe. With print shops growing evermore commonplace, rulers have found it hard to contain the new technique as the comparatively easy means of production means censorship can be sidestepped by moving business across a border or even just changing the name on a title page."

 confucian_events.1.d: "Our efforts to integrate our [pagan_province.Religion.GetName] subjects have now finally started to pay off. Our pagan subjects have begun to accept the ideals of [Root.GetReligionNoun] and our local officials have also integrated elements of the local religion and culture in our wider [Root.Religion.GetName] corpus of ideals. As local bureaucrats enter our administration the pagan customs have to some extent began to filter upwards. Even among prominent officials in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] a small altar can sometimes be found to a [pagan_province.Religion.GetName] pantheon.\nPaganism has become one of the many religions of our [Root.Religion.GetName] [Root.GovernmentName]."
 confucian_events.2.d: "Over time our Christian subjects have grown accustomed to our ways and taken to our rites and our superior administrative ideals. Where there was once distrust in the classics and our system for education and governance there is now widespread understanding. In turn our Christian subjects have been taken in and made part of our [Root.GovernmentName], and some of their customs have now become ours. In [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] even some of the best educated [Root.Religion.GetName] scholars can be seen partaking in Christian customs and visiting Christian churches."
 confucian_events.4.d: "The faith of the Dharmic peoples has been intertwined with our own for millennia yet our beliefs have diverged for almost as long. For a long time it was believed that where we lauded reason and classical learning they strived for diversity and an ancient spiritual power. Over the last years, however, we have strived to integrate the Dharmic society with ours and make their beliefs fit in with our equally strong traditions of philosophy and learning. As we look ahead a common future beckons where the diversity of the Dharmic pantheon can be cherished together with the [Root.Religion.GetName] classics. Together we have created a new stronger set of rites and traditions for a stronger and more durable state."
 confucian_events.5.d: "It has been centuries since the first Jews arrived in our country but it is not until recently that we have had this great numbers of them in our society. In a newfound fascination for their ancient Abrahamic religion we have done what we can to integrate them in our rites, traditions and education. As we have strived to harmonize the [Root.Religion.GetName] classics with the teachings of the Torah Jewish philosophers, traders, soldiers and artisans have become evermore present parts of our society. Eventually as traditions fuse these people have become a cornerstone of our [Root.GovernmentName]."
 confucian_events.6.d: "The bearers of a tradition that is said to be even older than our own the Zoroastrians are a people that have seen their political influence come and then fade. It was clear that we had much to learn from these teachings, as they could learn much from our superior tradition of reason, justice and fairness. When communities such as the one in [zoroastrian_province.GetName] became part of our [Root.GovernmentName] it allowed our traditions to begin a new phase of harmonization, fusing the ancient teachings of Zoroaster with those of [Root.GetReligionNoun]. We are still a country where the classics are learned and lived by but Zoroastrians are now an integral part of our society and to some extent their wisdom has become ours."
 confucian_events.7.d: "The Japanese have over time come to incorporate both the traditions of [Root.GetReligionNoun] and Buddhism into their own old Shinto faith, taking what they feel was the truest and best serving parts of the foreign teachings and making it their own. In many ways this has in turn made their religion easier to incorporate and harmonize with the ideology of [Root.GetName]. As time goes by the Shinto identity becomes less and less of an issue and Shinto followers can be found high and low in [Root.GetAdjective] society, forming a new group within our complex government apparatus that an outsider would have a very hard time distinguishing from our own."
 confucian_events.8.d: "The Pali Cannons of Theravada Buddhism are in many ways a familiar way to organize tradition and learning to our [Root.Religion.GetName] elites. Over time these collections of laws and rites have come to be studied and made part of the corpus that every educated and influential member of our society must study and adhere to. The traditions have been harmonized and the wider Theravada Buddhist community consider us their equal just as we consider the Theravada Buddhists within our borders as an integral part of our [Root.GovernmentName]."
 confucian_events.9.d: "Centuries ago the teachings of Buddha started to penetrate our lands and by now it is one of the most widespread religions in [Root.GetName]. While we hold the classics of [Root.Religion.GetName] learning to be the guiding principle of our [Root.GovernmentName] we also honor the traditions of Buddha and the yearning for an end to the eternal cycle that many of our subjects feel.\nTruly we are a [Root.Religion.GetName] country ruled by a people of Mahayana Buddhists."
 confucian_events.10.d: "Those of our subjects that are ardent followers of the great and mysterious Lamas have increasingly come to realize how useful an ideology the teachings of [Root.GetReligionNoun] are. Where they once used the traditions of the Vajrayana way to judge the world they are now incorporating the same classics that we have. Vajrayana monks and nobles are now part of our government both at the very top and at the very bottom and their somewhat wild and Tantric traditions appears to have been tamed by our reason and learning."
 confucian_events.11.d: "The followers of the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] faith have increasingly come to integrate [Root.Religion.GetName] concepts and our rites in their daily life. A recent trend is to identify the concept of Shangdi with their own supreme deities. This interpretation is somewhat unorthodox to the scholar experts of our [Root.GovernmentName], but it has allowed the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] faithful to integrate a number of [Root.Religion.GetName] concepts, rites, constants and classical teaching in their theology.\nThere is some debate in the palace halls of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] if this is the right and proper way on the path for the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] adherents to elevate themselves from barbarians to Hua."
 confucian_events.12.d: "Believers of the [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] faith are a people with strong traditions and rites and their adherence to the archaic language of their own teachings is holding them back from progressing towards civilization. If they are to ever elevate themselves from the Barbarian Yi of this world we must perhaps ensure that the classics and the proper rites are available for them to digest in their own language.\nThere are some scholars that have already begun to create such works. Should we encourage them to continue synthesizing their old religious concepts with the sublime principles of [Root.GetReligionNoun]?"
 confucian_events.14.d: "While they are part of our [Root.GovernmentName] some [harmonization_province.Religion.GetName] traditions can be very hard to stomach. A civilized people is supposed to abide by what is right and logical according the [Root.Religion.GetName] teachings, but these men and women have many customs in direct contradiction of such rules. Our officials in [harmonization_province.GetName] have been struggling with the locals who insist on their barbarous ways."
 confucian_events.19.d: "A vernacular novel about a well-known story from the [Root.GetOldEra] era is rapidly gaining popularity among our subjects. This in itself is not a problem but it has come to our attention that this novelization is in fact breaking central tenets of [Root.Religion.GetName] ideology as it could be seen as an argument for disobeying central authority and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].\nOur administrators now argue that the book must be banned, though some fear this will only make it more alluring to those that wish to read it."
 confucian_events.20.d: "Education, self-improvement and adherence to the classics are the backbone of [Root.GetReligionNoun] and if our [Root.GovernmentName] is to aspire to greatness we must at all times devote money, attention and energy to ensuring that our officials are as well educated and well informed as they can possibly be. It is therefore of some concern that the number of people seeking government employment seem to be decreasing as of late."

 aow_events.12.d: "War is seldom without brutality. Soldiers are not known for their mercy, but this war has seen some exceptionally vile behavior on the part of our occupying forces. It appears that the mercenary band we have sent to occupy [Root.GetAreaName] are unsatisfied with the wages we provide them and have resorted to robbing the civilian population. Their actions have tainted the image of all our troops. As extortion by means of terror and torture becomes commonplace, [root_controller.GetAdjective] soldiers are reviled as well as feared and stories of their atrocities spread well beyond the borders of the war."
 aow_events.13.d: "The enemy occupation of [Root.GetAreaName] has come at a great cost for its people. Driven by a mixture of greed and desperation, the mercenary band hired by [root_controller.GetName], has violently plundered and terrorized local civilians in an attempt to extort money and resources."
 corruption_event.16.d: "During wartime, soldiers of fortune often find ways to make it home with a bit more than they are paid by raiding the land where they are sent to fight. Normally, this is not a problem for us when they are sent abroad to terrorize our enemies, but sometimes this habit is hard to break, even during peacetime. Some farmers and travelers in [hired_mercs_victim_area.GetAreaName] have complained that a mercenary band in our employ stationed there have been robbing and extorting them, despite - or perhaps because of - the fact that there isn't even a war ongoing.\n\nMeddling in the ranks of mercenaries, even ones that we hired, is always a difficult matter.

These cities are not only influential in a spiritual sense, they also command their own defense forces composed of anything from the Samurai of low level landholders to armed farmers and monks. The Ikko-Ikki communes represent a parallel authority not only to the Shogunate but to any Daimyo controlling the surrounding lands.\nOne such commune has sprung up around a temple in [ikko_province.GetName], and while we might be able to benefit from their support, this potent mix of religious fervor, weapons and autonomy poses a threat to Daimyo authority.\n\nCurrent Incident Value: §G[Root.ikko_ikki_var.GetValue]§!"

One of the more prominent scholars of this age is himself the son of a Ronin, and along with other Confucian Scholars he is intent on making learning more widely available through public lectures and books written in simple language.\nIn many ways this is a challenge to the old social order, where learning was a privilege reserved for the families of the right lineages.\n\nCurrent Incident Value: §G[Root.neo_confucianism_var.GetValue]§!"

 shinto_events.26.d: "Ever since the arrival of the westerners some have regarded them with distrust. Their pockets are deep, their weapons powerful and, to some, their culture seems fascinating. Those that deal with these traders, however, report that the Europeans are constantly plotting against each other. Scarcely a meeting with foreign emissaries goes by in which they do not warn us of some plot or scheme by their adversaries. It is clear we are not dealing with men of honor.\nAs a new group of traders request that we increase their privileges our advisors caution us to consider the offer carefully.\n\nCurrent Incident Value: §G[Root.nanban_var.GetValue]§!"
 shinto_events.27.d: "The trade post in [nanban_traders_here.GetName] has started to attract not only merchants but also scholars and intellectuals. To these men the books that the foreigners bring are far more valuable than the goods they wish to sell. The study of western science and culture, Rangaku, is growing into its own discipline, and according to the adherents we have much to learn. Many clerics are skeptical, however, as are some Confucian scholars.\n\nCurrent Incident Value: §G[Root.nanban_var.GetValue]§!"
 shinto_events.28.d: "Some argue that we are making ourselves too dependent on the foreign traders. Our own artisans are surely no less gifted than those abroad, and instead of spending a fortune importing manufactured goods from the outside world we might produce many of them.

 shinto_events.32.d: "With the arrival of western traders the first portable firearms have come to our realm. These weapons are unlike the ones used here, and they promise to revolutionize warfare should they become widespread. Acquiring enough of them is not as straightforward as it might seem, however. The muskets are in great demand among those that have seen their power, but the prospect of what they could do in the hands of our enemies, or even an unruly peasant community, is also quite disturbing.\nAs we start to produce and instruct our soldiers in the use of these arms we will need to decide who will have access to these guns and how many we will make.\n\nPossible Incident Outcomes:\nIncident Value <3: §G+20.0%§!

 shinto_events.34.d: "With the novelty of firearms wearing off, it has become clear that they are not as efficient as their early proponents claimed. Through training we might surely increase their efficiency, and some of our smiths have also suggested ways to improve the weapons themselves. Others would argue that we should spend the time of both our smiths and our soldiers on more traditional arms. The weapons of our ancestors still seem most influential in battles, and we would perhaps do well to honor their traditions.\n\nCurrent Incident Value: §G[Root.firearms_var.GetValue]§!"
 shinto_events.38.d: "With the arrival of Europeans we have come into contact with a new culture and a new religion. In some ways it seems similar to ours, but in others it is completely alien to us. A group of men has arrived in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName], trying to preach the gospel of a Kirishitan god. Their message appears to be very odd, however, likely due to incompetent or ill-willed translators.\nIn their eagerness to secure the patronage of [Root.Monarch.GetName] the missionaries have appeared bearing no gifts and spouting nonsense.
